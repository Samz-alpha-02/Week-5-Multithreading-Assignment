    "\n",
    "The threading module in Python is used for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Concurrent Execution: The primary purpose of the threading module is to enable concurrent execution of\n",
    "                        multiple threads within a program. It allows different tasks to be performed \n",
    "                        simultaneously, taking advantage of multiple processor cores or executing time-consuming \n",
    "                        operations in the background while the main thread remains responsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Responsiveness: By using threads, you can keep the main thread responsive to user input or other events \n",
    "                  while performing lengthy computations or blocking operations in separate threads. This \n",
    "                  prevents the program from becoming unresponsive or freezing during resource-intensive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Parallelism: Threading enables parallelism, which is particularly useful for CPU-bound tasks. When you have \n",
    "               multiple CPU-intensive tasks, you can assign each task to a separate thread, allowing them to \n",
    "               run in parallel and potentially improve overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Resource Sharing: Threads within a process can share data and resources more easily compared to separate \n",
    "                    processes. This makes threading useful for scenarios where multiple threads need to\n",
    "                    access and modify shared data structures or communicate with each other efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Synchronization: The threading module provides synchronization primitives such as locks, semaphores, and \n",
    "                   condition variables, which help control and coordinate access to shared resources. These\n",
    "                   synchronization mechanisms ensure that threads can safely access shared data without \n",
    "                   conflicts or race conditions.\n",

    "complex programs. By breaking down a program into smaller threads, each responsible for a specific task,\n",
    "the overall program structure can become more modular and easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Resource Sharing: Multithreading allows threads to share resources such as memory, files, and network\n",
    "connections. This can lead to more efficient resource utilization and better coordination among different\n",
    "parts of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Parallelism and Concurrency: Multithreading enables parallelism and concurrency in a program. \n",

    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Complexity and Difficulty: Multithreaded programming introduces complexities, such as race conditions, \n",
    "deadlocks, and synchronization issues. It can be challenging to reason about the behavior of concurrent\n",
    "threads and ensure correct synchronization and data sharing. Debugging and troubleshooting multithreaded \n",
    "programs can also be more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Increased Overhead: Multithreading introduces additional overhead due to context switching, \n",
    "synchronization mechanisms, and coordination among threads. This overhead can impact overall performance, \n",
    "especially if there is excessive thread creation or contention for shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Potential for Bugs and Difficult-to-Reproduce Issues: Multithreading introduces the possibility of subtle \n",

    "Deadlocks:\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release \n",
    "resources that they hold. In other words, it is a situation where a set of threads are unable to proceed\n",
    "because each thread is waiting for a resource that is held by another thread in the set.\n",

    "A deadlock typically arises when the following conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource must be held in a mutually exclusive manner, meaning it can be \n",
    "                    used by only one thread at a time.\n",
    "2.Hold and Wait: A thread holds one or more resources while waiting for others.\n",
    "3.No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a thread. A thread must voluntarily \n",
    "                 release a resource.\n",
    "4.Circular Wait: There exists a circular chain of threads, where each thread is waiting for a resource \n",

    "\n",
    "Race Conditions:\n",
